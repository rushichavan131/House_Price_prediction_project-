Project Title: House Price Prediction

Objective:

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the price of a house based on its features and characteristics. The model should be able to learn from historical data and make predictions on new, unseen data.

Problem Statement:

Predicting house prices is a complex task that involves analyzing various factors such as location, size, age, condition, and amenities. Real estate agents, buyers, and sellers need a reliable and accurate way to estimate house prices to make informed decisions. However, manual estimation methods can be time-consuming, subjective, and prone to errors.

Dataset:

The dataset for this project consists of 229780 rows and 12 columns, featuring various attributes of houses, including:

Location: City, state, zip code, etc.
Physical Characteristics: Number of bedrooms, bathrooms, house_size, etc.
Condition: status.
Price: The target variable, representing the sale price of the house.
Task:

The task is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the price of a house based on its features and characteristics. The model should be trained on the provided dataset and evaluated on its performance using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared.

Deliverables:

The project deliverables include:

A written report detailing the methodology, results, and conclusions
A Python code implementation of the predictive model
A dataset with the predicted prices for a test set of houses
A presentation summarizing the project findings and results
Evaluation Metrics:

The performance of the model will be evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average of the squared differences between predicted and actual prices.
R-squared: The coefficient of determination, measuring the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
